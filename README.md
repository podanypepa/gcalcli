Google Calendar CLI

Because I am very busy person I need some light and easy tool for better
management my work with events in Google Calendar.

Respective: I have more Google accounts and I need join and manage all accounts 
and all events from one place.

Next goal will be make some posibilities for integration my tool to another apps.
